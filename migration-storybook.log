│   Vite) and defaults to make integrations easier.                                                                                                │

The migration successfully updated your 'stories' config to include any .mdx file instead of just .stories.mdx.

It also ran the 'mdx-to-csf' codemod to convert your MDX stories to CSF format.
This codemod is not perfect however, so you may need to manually fix any issues it couldn't handle.
